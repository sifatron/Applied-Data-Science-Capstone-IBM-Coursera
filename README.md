Project Background and Context
SpaceX revolutionizes the commercial space industry by making space travel more affordable. A Falcon 9 rocket launch costs 62 million dollars, significantly less than other providers charging over 165 million dollars. This cost reduction is due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of their rockets. Predicting the success of these landings can help estimate launch costs. Using public data and machine learning, this project aims to predict the reusability of Falcon 9's first stage.

Questions to Be Answered
How do factors like payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits affect first stage landing success?
Has the success rate of landings improved over the years?
Can we predict the success of a first stage landing for new launches based on historical data?
What is the best binary classification algorithm for this prediction?
What factors ensure a successful launch, and how can this information optimize future launches?
